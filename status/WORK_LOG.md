## Session 2 — 2026-09-12 — spec corrections + repo baseline

Date / agent / branch / packet: 2026-09-12 / orchestrator + spec-fix agent / main / cross-cutting spec corrections (founder-approved deviations D17–D20).

Actual files and behavior implemented:
- Git baseline: repo initialized, seed committed as `3b477ee`; corrections committed on top.
- IntentV1 gains signed `references` field (u8 count 0–8 + 32B each; descriptive ancestry, non-economic); schemas, fixtures and wire doc updated; new `schemas/statement.schema.json` and `TESSERA:STATEMENT:1` StatementV1 vocabulary (APP_DEFINED, KEY_CONTINUITY, RELEASE_ANCHOR, RETRACTION_OR_DISPUTE); custody default re-ranked to platform-provisioned server-custodied Ed25519 with export (embedded provider optional); RELEASE_ANCHOR binds release manifest digest to economic leaf.
- New tools: `tools/check_shared.py` (SHA-256 drift check against sibling repo), `tools/regen_intent_fixture.py` (CSPRNG test-key fixture generator; private key never written).
- Fixtures regenerated for the new wire layout (348-byte intent, fresh test keypair, signature verified + tamper-rejected).
- `evidence-bundle` `kind` enum gained `statement`/`manifest`; budget doc notes on-chain reference storage (~260B/node worst case) and Supabase free-tier ~7-day inactivity pause.

Commands run and exact results: `validate_seed.py --skip-inventory` passed (113 links, 11 JSON); `reference_economics.py --self-test` passed; `inspect_signature_fixture.py` verified_and_tamper_rejected; `check_shared.py` passed (7 files identical to Morpheus).

Contract/migration/security implications: IntentV1 wire layout changed pre-deployment (permitted); `shared/` edits mirrored byte-identically; no deployed state exists to migrate. Statement instruction still not implemented — record format specified only.

External gates and smallest needed founder action: none for these changes. Repo visibility/remote still founder's call; Solana/Anchor toolchain absent on Windows (WSL2 or cloud env needed before T03 program build).

Saved commit/artifact and next ready packet: correction commit on main; T01 ready next.

## Seed delivery — 2026-09-11

Specification/research/agent packets supplied. Applications, program deployment, real provider setup, payments and legal clearance have not been completed. Reference math/schema tests have their own report; do not treat them as production application tests.
